    <h1>description</h1>
        <p>Turkey sliders are a prime choice for when you’re on the go and you don’t have time to devour a huge, juicy burger. The carb swap for the bun is roasted sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes can help fill up your micronutrient requirements for the day, and they actually do have a muscular angle. Muscle cramps can be the worst, putting a complete halt to a workout. Having a sufficient amount of potassium and magnesium in your system can prevent that from happening. So it may be wise to make turkey sliders your pre-workout meal.</h1>
